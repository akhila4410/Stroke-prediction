# Stroke-prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

This dataset predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

I built a model that can be used to predict stroke using KNN Classifier

Implemented Steps:
1. Import the Required Libraries
2. Read the CSV file
3. Preprocess the data
4. Split the data (train & test)
5. Build the KNN model
6. Predict the test data
7.Calculate the score of the model
